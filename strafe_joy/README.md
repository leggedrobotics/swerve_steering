# strafe_joy
Gamepad setup. Takes a joy input and converts to a command velocity.

Also switches controllers. To do so, press the start and select buttons on the gamepad to switch between swerve steering controller and configuration controller. It also unfreezes the brake drives upon switching to the config change controller.

Launch this using the included launch file on whatever computer you have your gamepad connected to. This launch file can also be used to change the button configuration if you plan on using another gamepad.
