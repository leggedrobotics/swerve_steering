## Docker
The easiest way to run a demo on your local machine is to use docker.
Fetch the image from dockerhub with:
```
docker pull rslethz/swerve_mpc
```
Alternatively, build a docker image by cloning this repository and running the following command:
```
docker image build -t rslethz/swerve_mpc .
```
Run the simulation with this command:
```
xhost local:root &&\
docker container run -it --rm --name swerve_simulation_demo \
 -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
 --device /dev/dri \
 rslethz/swerve_mpc /bin/bash -c "source devel/setup.bash && roslaunch swerve_control simulation.launch"
```
If a joystick is connected to the port `/dev/input/js0`, you can give the container access to it:
```
xhost local:root &&\
docker container run -it --rm --name swerve_simulation_demo \
 -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
 --device /dev/dri --device /dev/input/js0 \
 rslethz/swerve_mpc /bin/bash -c "source devel/setup.bash && roslaunch swerve_control simulation.launch"
```
 
The reconfiguration scripts can be called as follows:
```
docker exec swerve_simulation_demo /bin/bash -c "source devel/setup.bash && rosrun swerve_mpc x_open.py"
```

## Local Installation
The code has been tested with Ubuntu 20.04 and ros-noetic.
Install the following tools to fetch the dependencies:
```
sudo apt install python3-catkin-tools python3-rosdep git python3-vcstool
```

Create a new catkin workspace and clone this repo into the src dir.

Clone all source dependencies into the src dir with vcstool:
```
vcs import . < ../dependencies_exact.rosinstall --recursive --shallow
```

Use rosdep to install all binary dependencies:
```
rosdep update && rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
```

Compile all packages with:
```
catkin build swerve_control
```

### Gazebo Simulation
To launch in simulation, run:
```
roslaunch swerve_control simulation.launch
```
By default, the gazebo simulator starts with an empty world. In `swerve_description/launch/gazebo.launch`, the world file can be specified. We provide the file `slope.world` to test the SE3 motion model of the MPC. For deployments on slopes, the state estimator can be activated by setting the argument `use_state_estimator` in `swerve_control/launch/highlevel_controller.launch` to true.

The MPC ros controller can be activated with the `rqt_controller_manager` GUI. Navigation commands can be send to the robot with the `rviz` goal pose marker or a joystick.
Reconfiguration can be triggered with the rosservice `/swerve_base/brakes_service` or the following scripts:
```
rosrun swerve_mpc x_open.py
rosrun swerve_mpc x_close.py
rosrun swerve_mpc h_open.py
rosrun swerve_mpc h_close.py
rosrun swerve_mpc a_open.py
rosrun swerve_mpc a_close.py
```
The `open` scripts open the brakes and allow for reconfiguration. The `close` scripts fix the base at the current configuration. Please note that a navigation goal needs to be sent while reconfiguring.
